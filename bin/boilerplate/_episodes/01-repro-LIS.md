keypoints:
- "The term 'reproducibility' has been used in different ways in different disciplinary contexts."
- "Computational reproducibility, which is the focus of this and follow-up lessons, refers tot he duplication of reported findings by re-executing the analysis with the same data and code used by the original researcher to generate their findings."
-"Scientific reproducibility is not a novel concept, but one that has been reiterated by prominent scholars throughout history as a cornerstone of scientific practice."
-"Failed attempts to reproduce published scientific resarch are considered by some to be reflective of an ongoing crisis in scientific integrity, which may affect public trust in science."

## Defining "Reproducibility"
The term, *reproducibility*, can carry very different meanings depending on the context in which it is used.  Thus, it is important for us to begin by disambiguating among these various terms and their meanings.  To do this, we define three specific types of reproducibility that articulate the primary distinctions among the various conceptions of reproducibility defined by Victoria Stodden (2015): *empirical reproducibility*, *statistical reproducibility*, and *computational reproducibility*.

### Empirical Reproducibility
Empirical reproducibility assumes the presence of comprehensive documentation of research methods and protocols for a research study that allow subsequent studies that apply the same research methods and protocols to yield results that corroborate those reported by the original investigators.

### Statistical Reproducibility
Statistical reproducibility relies on the application of appropriate statistical methods to yield defensible results.  Studies that suffer from statistical irreproducibility have weaknesses in the statistical methods and analysis, which precludes the possibility of repeating the study and yielding the same results.

### Computational Reproducibility
Computational reproducibility considers scientific practice that relies on computational methods to produce results.  That ability to use the original same data and code to produce identical results as those of the original study describes computational reproducibility.

> ## The Definitive Definition of "Reproducibility"
> In discussions of reproducibility, you also may have seen the terms *replicability*, *verifiability*, *repeatability*, and *transparency* used to describe any one of the three definitions provided above.  These terms have been used interchangeably and with conflating definitions, ultimately obfuscating their intended meanings.  However, it does seem that the scientific community is converging on clearer definitions that capture the nuances of these related terms.
>
> A recent report published by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (2019) makes a clear distinction between reproducibility and replicability as a means to resolve ambiguities in the use of these and related terms.  Their definitions are below as presented in the report:
>
> *Reproducibility* is obtaining consistent results using the same input data; computational steps, methods, and code; and conditions of analysis.  This definition is synonymous with “computational reproducibility”...
>
> *Replicability* is obtaining consistent results across studies aimed at answering the same scientific question, each of which has obtained its own data (p. 46).
