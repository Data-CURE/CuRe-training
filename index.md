This is the first of a series of lessons in the Data Curation for Reproducibility curriculum, which offers learners working in research data support roles with the knowledge and practical skills to properly execute data curation and code review workflows that support research reproducibility.

The goal of this introductory lesson is to provide learners with foundational knowledge for understanding and engaging in discourses around research reproducibility and to learn the strategies used by information professionals to manage, curate, and steward research artifacts (i.e., data, documentation, and code) that serve as the evidence base for reported scientific findings.  This lesson also prepares learners to perform data curation and code review activities taught in subsequent lessons of the Data Curation for Reproducibility curriculum.
